# RustyPHP Trademark & Brand Policy

The name "RustyPHP", the RustyPHP word mark, and the RustyPHP logo (the "Marks")
are project identifiers for this open source implementation. Copyright © 2025
Amin Shamim and Contributors. All rights reserved.

This policy clarifies how you may use the Marks while preserving their meaning
and preventing confusion about project origin or endorsement.

## Permitted Uses (No Separate Permission Required)
- Accurate references to the upstream project: "Built with RustyPHP", "Powered by RustyPHP".
- Unmodified screenshots or terminal output demonstrating RustyPHP.
- Forks referencing original lineage: "AcmeEngine (a fork of RustyPHP)".
- Packaging/distribution of unmodified source or compiled artifacts with original LICENSE and NOTICE files intact.

## Prohibited Without Prior Written Permission
- Using the Marks in a way that suggests official sponsorship, partnership, or endorsement.
- Naming a fork or derivative in a confusingly similar way: e.g. "Official RustyPHP", "RustyPHP Pro", "RustyPHP Enterprise".
- Altering the logo, recoloring, distorting, or creating derivative logos implying origin.
- Registering domain names or social handles that could be misread as official (e.g. rustyphp-official.example).
- Using the Marks in commercial product names as the primary distinctive element.

## Fork Naming Guidance
Choose names that clearly distinguish your project while acknowledging origin.
Examples:
- ✅ "AcmeRuntime (fork of RustyPHP)"
- ✅ "AcmePHP Engine (based on RustyPHP)"
- ❌ "RustyPHP Enhanced"
- ❌ "RustyPHP Premium"

## Attribution
If you redistribute modified versions, retain the original copyright notice in
LICENSE / NOTICE and add a statement like:
"Modified version of RustyPHP (https://github.com/aminshamim/RustyPHP)."

## Logo Usage
Use only the provided official logo asset without modification. Do not overlay
new text, change aspect ratio, or apply filters that materially alter
recognition.

## Clarifying Independence
RustyPHP is independent and not affiliated with the PHP Group or Zend Engine.
If you describe compatibility, use phrasing like: "RustyPHP executes PHP 8.x
compatible code" instead of implying official certification.

## Requesting Permission
For uses outside these guidelines, open a GitHub issue or contact the maintainer.
Include:
- Intended use
- Distribution channel
- Visual mockups (if logo usage)
- Timeline

## Disclaimers
This policy does not grant any rights in third-party marks (including "PHP").
"PHP" is a widely recognized mark of the PHP Group. Respect their guidelines.

This document may be updated periodically. Substantive changes will appear in
project release notes or the repository history.
